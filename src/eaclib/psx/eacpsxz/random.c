 *   FULL reconstruction (disasm-v3 MIPS); NOT stubs.  A 192-bit additive PRNG with carry.
 *
 *   State = six 32-bit words @0x8012349C (obj-local rodata->RW, materialized; init == seedrandom(0)).
 *   Each step folds the words together with full carry propagation, then increments the 192-bit
 *   counter, and returns the top word.  seedrandom loads the six words from a running sum of fixed
 *   constants offset by the seed.
