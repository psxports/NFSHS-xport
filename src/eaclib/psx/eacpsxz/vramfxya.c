/* eaclib/psx/eacpsxz/vramfxya.c -- RECONSTRUCTED from nfs4-f.exe. NOT original source.  *** 1/1 ***
 *   obj nfs4\eaclib\psx\vramfxya.obj ; EACPSXZ.LIB (xlsx col12 / SYM v3 FILE record line 360607).
 *   3 fns: checkrect @0x800F6934 (44 B), vramimage @0x800F6960 (72 B), vramfxya @0x800F69A8 (660 B).
 *   FX-A shape -> VRAM uploader: walks a shape's chunk chain and DMAs each bitmap chunk (tags 0x40..0x43)
 *   and CLUT chunk (tags 0x22/0x23/0x24) into VRAM at the requested (x,y).  CLUT chunks are colour-reduced
 *   to 15-bit BGR on the way (>>1 for 0x22, >>3 for 0x24; 0x23 uploads the raw words unchanged).
 *   Ghidra nfs4-f.exe.c (all 3) + disasm-v3 (vramfxya: IDA sig recovers the 5 dropped reg/stack args;
 *   the compiler jump table @0x80056FD8 is rendered as a plain switch) + IDA sigs.  Plain C -> extern "C".
 *
 *   Shape chunk header (uint* `c`):
 *     c[0]  : low byte = tag; bits 8.. = byte offset to next chunk (0 in the high 24 bits => end of chain)
 *     c[1]  : low short = entry/pixel count
 *     c[3]  : packed VRAM xy = (c[3] & 0xf000f000) | x&0xfff | (y&0xfff)<<16
 *     c+4   : pixel / CLUT source data; CLUT entries are 3 bytes (R,G,B) at byte offsets 0x10,0x11,0x12
